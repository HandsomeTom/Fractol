# Fractol

Time for some fractals. The goal of this project is to simply show the user a mandelbrot set or julia sets.

*Usage: ./fractol [mandelbrot, julia, satan]*

Right mouse click to snap to cursor location, mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Arrow keys do linear position shifting, so you might not want to use them if you have zoomed too deep into the rabbit hole.

This project uses *MiniLibX*
>Simplified X-Window (X11R6) programming API written in C, suitable for X-beginners.
